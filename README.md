### Useful resources

- [Responsive Bento Grid | CSS Tutorial | Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4dHvo09cG4&t=3090s) - This tutorial helped me understand how to use CSS custom properties (variables) effectively in real-world layouts. I saw how custom properties can simplify theme management, spacing, and responsiveness in a clean, scalable way. I really liked the bento grid pattern and plan to use it going forward in modern, responsive UI designs.
